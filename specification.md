# specification

The purpose of this document is to specify exactly the requirements and
behaviours of a project using the lambda pattern.

## jargon

### lambda pattern

The lambda pattern is a set of prescribed organisations and behaviours for a
lambda pattern project. The most important principle of the lambda pattern is to
have a src folder and a gen folder. The src folder is as human editable as
possible. The gen folder should not be edited. It should be generated by the
lambda pattern tool.

### lambda pattern project

A lambda pattern project follows the lambda pattern.

### lambda pattern tool

A command line tool which is used for creating and maintaining a lambda pattern
project.

### lambda pattern skeleton

The basic outline of the project which is not updated by the lambda pattern
tool.

This is the skeleton for an es6 lambda pattern project:

```
root
├── gen
│   ├── release
│   ├── stored
│   │   └── working_build_scripts
│   │       └── current.js
│   └── .gitignore
├── src
│   ├── [project name]
│   │   │── [project_name.es6]
│   │   └── [project_name_test.es6]
│   └── lambda
│       ├─── build.es6
│       ├─── metadata
│       ├─── npm_dependencies
│       └─── npm_dev_dependencies
├── LICENCE.md
└── README.md
```

### lambda pattern updatables

A set of files that are created by the lambda pattern tool at a particular
updatables version number. Lambda pattern projects should keep the version
number as recent as possible.

The updatables exist in a repository (for example 'lambda pattern updatables
es6') and the updatables version number is a revision number for that repo. Most
of the behavior of the lambda pattern tool for building is specified in the
updatables repo, so that old lambda pattern projects don't break.

## steps

### create [name]

* create a folder called [name]
* set up the skeleton inside the folder

### build dev

* make sure the gen/.updatables folder exists and fits the expected version
* make a symlink from gen/stored/working_build_scripts/current.js to
    gen/build.js
* run the build.dev(path) function, passing the gen folder as a parameter
