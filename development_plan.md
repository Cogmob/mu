figure out how to get build gulpfile to run now that everything has been refactored
    should be made flexible and write down method
    auto add documentation to beginning of .js file when generated
make example folder with tests that should pass
make script that discovers the tests within the folders at build time (jspm)
put together tree of test dependencies
make a suggested test order
make way to run all tests, pass in name of single test to run or run all dependencies for single test
